# Melli's browser Games

# Play the Games
most games are online under https://melli79.github.io/games .

# Run the Code
You can explore the code in any IDE for Kotlin.  Support of gradle/kotlin scripts is preferable.  At the time of writing the best supporting IDE is IntelliJ (Ultimate).

in order to locally run a game, all you need to do is start the gradlew[.bat] browserRun. The game 
itself runs in a browser (and is served via a local node server).
